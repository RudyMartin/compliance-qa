Next Priority Areas:

  1. Test the Clean Separation ðŸ§ª

  - Run the lean portals we created
  - Verify TidyLLM works without infrastructure dependencies
  - Test DSPy portal with real markdown â†’ AI program conversion

  2. Complete Service Layer Migration ðŸ”„

  Based on our todo list, we still need to:
  - Make remaining TidyLLM portals thin (just UI calling services)
  - Move more business logic to domain services
  - Ensure all infrastructure code is out of TidyLLM

  3. Create Working Examples ðŸ“š

  Following the roadmap Phase 2-3:
  - End-to-end compliance workflow using the new architecture
  - DSPy advisor integrated with workflow
  - Document processing pipeline using clean TidyLLM

  4. Portal Orchestration ðŸŽ¼

  From the roadmap Phase 5:
  - Portal discovery system
  - Central dashboard for all 7 portals
  - Health monitoring across services

  5. Package & Deploy ðŸ“¦

  - Create proper setup.py for TidyLLM as a library
  - Test pip install tidyllm works cleanly
  - Document the API for both TidyLLM and Compliance-QA

  Which area would you like to tackle first? I'd recommend either:
  - Testing what we built to ensure it works
  - Creating a working example to demonstrate the architecture
  - Continuing service extraction to finish the separation

  What's your preference?

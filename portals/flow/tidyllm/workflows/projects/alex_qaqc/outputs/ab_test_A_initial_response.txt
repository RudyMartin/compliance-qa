Here is a quick initial analysis for the QA/QC workflow question:

The key aspects to focus on are:

Metadata Extraction:
- Identify all relevant metadata fields that need to be captured (e.g. data source, collection date, sensor info, etc.)
- Ensure a standardized, automated process to extract this metadata consistently

Analysis Steps:
- Define a set of data quality checks and validation rules to apply (e.g. range checks, completeness, outlier detection)
- Implement these checks in a modular, reusable analysis workflow

Results Aggregation:
- Consolidate the results of the various data quality checks into a central report or dashboard
- Summarize pass/fail rates, data quality scores, and any identified issues

Recording Questions:
- Establish a system to log any data quality questions or issues that arise
- Link these back to the original data and analysis for future reference

Recommendations:
- Design the workflow as a set of independent, interchangeable modules for flexibility
- Leverage existing QA/QC frameworks and libraries where possible to accelerate development
- Implement robust error handling and logging to aid in troubleshooting
- Consider using a workflow orchestration tool to manage the end-to-end process

This should provide a good starting point. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

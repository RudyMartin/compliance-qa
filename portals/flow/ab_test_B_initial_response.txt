For the QA/QC workflow for data quality assessment, here's a quick initial analysis:

Metadata Extraction:
- Implement automated metadata extraction from data sources to capture key attributes like source, timestamp, data types, etc.
- Consider using a centralized metadata repository for easy access and analysis.

Analysis Steps:
- Define a standardized set of data quality checks (e.g., completeness, validity, consistency, integrity) based on business rules and requirements.
- Prioritize checks based on criticality and potential impact on downstream processes.
- Automate the execution of these checks as much as possible for efficiency and consistency.

Results Aggregation:
- Establish a centralized repository or dashboard to consolidate and visualize QA/QC results from various data sources and checks.
- Implement alerting mechanisms for critical issues and exceptions.

Recording Questions:
- Maintain a knowledge base or FAQ section to document common data quality issues, root causes, and resolutions.
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.

Template Ordering and Execution Strategy:
- Implement a modular and extensible framework for the QA/QC workflow, allowing easy addition or modification of checks.
- Consider a parallel execution strategy for independent checks to improve performance.
- Prioritize checks based on data criticality and dependencies, executing higher-priority checks first.
- Implement checkpoints for manual intervention and review, if necessary.

Key Recommendations:
- Automate as much as possible for consistency and efficiency.
- Centralize metadata, results, and knowledge for easier access and analysis.
- Prioritize and modularize checks for flexibility and performance optimization.

Test Enhanced VectorQA Integration
==================================

Demonstrates how the enhanced TextExtractor from VectorQA now includes
the smart capabilities from the ZIP file, working seamlessly with existing
S3 and sentence embeddings.

Shows integration with:
- Enhanced TextExtractor (smart chunking, S3 bytes processing)
- Existing S3SessionManager from VectorQA whitepapers
- TidyLLM sentence embeddings
- Y=R+S+N research framework

    Model validation is a critical component of model risk management in financial institutions.
    The process ensures that models perform as expected and meet regulatory requirements.
    
    Key validation components include conceptual soundness review, ongoing monitoring, and outcome analysis.
    Conceptual soundness examines theoretical foundations and assumptions underlying the model.
    Ongoing monitoring tracks model performance over time to detect potential degradation.
    Outcome analysis compares model predictions with actual results to assess accuracy.
    
    Basel III requirements specify that banks must maintain robust validation frameworks.
    These frameworks should address model development, implementation, use, and performance monitoring.
    Regular validation helps identify model limitations and potential improvements.
    
    Documentation requirements are essential for regulatory compliance and internal governance.
    Institutions must maintain comprehensive records of development, testing, and monitoring activities.
    This documentation supports regulatory examinations and internal audit processes.

## üí° Creating Your Own Domain Mode

### Template
```yaml
name: "YOUR_DOMAIN_MODE"
components:
  model: "claude-3-[haiku|sonnet|opus]"
  temperature: 0.0-1.0
  adapter: "[Direct|RAG|DSPy|Hybrid]"

    - Feature 2
use_cases:
    - Use case 1
    - Use case 2
```

### Best Practices
1. **Start with existing mode** - Modify a similar domain's configuration
2. **Test temperature** - Try different values to find optimal balance
3. **Measure performance** - Track response time, cost, and quality
4. **Iterate based on feedback** - Adjust based on user needs
5. **Document your mode** - Help others understand and use it

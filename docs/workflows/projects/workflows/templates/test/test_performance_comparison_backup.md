## 📊 Performance Metrics Guide

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Processing Time (ms)**
   - Lower = faster execution
   - Target: < 30,000ms for most workflows

2. **Confidence Improvement**
   - Higher = better quality enhancement
   - Target: > 0.25 improvement from Stage 1 to Stage 2

3. **Token Usage**
   - Lower = more cost-efficient
   - Balance with quality requirements

4. **Parallel Speedup Factor**
   - > 1.5x = parallel execution recommended
   - < 1.2x = sequential execution sufficient

## 🚀 Execution Mode Comparison

### Parallel Execution (Recommended)
- **Benefits**: Maximum speed, efficient resource usage
- **Best For**: Multiple test comparison, time-sensitive analysis
- **Concurrent Streams**: 1-4 simultaneous tests
- **Speedup**: 2-4x faster than sequential

### Sequential Execution (Controlled)
- **Benefits**: Controlled timing, resource management
- **Best For**: Resource-constrained environments, debugging
- **Execution**: One test at a time with delays
- **Reliability**: Higher stability, easier troubleshooting

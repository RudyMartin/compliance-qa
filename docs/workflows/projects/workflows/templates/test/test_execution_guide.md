## ⚙️ Execution Mode Selection

### Parallel Execution (Recommended)
```yaml
When to Use:
  - Multiple tests selected (2-4)
  - Time-sensitive analysis
  - Resource capacity available
  - Normal operation conditions

Configuration:
  - Max Concurrent: 2-4 streams
  - Resource Planning: Monitor AWS limits
  - Expected Speedup: 2-4x faster

Benefits:
  - Maximum efficiency
  - Simultaneous comparison
  - Optimal resource utilization
```

### Sequential Execution (Controlled)
```yaml
When to Use:
  - Resource constraints
  - Debugging/troubleshooting
  - Controlled timing requirements
  - Single test validation

Configuration:
  - Delay Between Tests: 1-10 seconds
  - Resource Planning: Single stream
  - Expected Duration: Sum of individual tests

Benefits:
  - Predictable resource usage
  - Easier monitoring
  - Stable execution
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Validation

### Real-Time Monitoring

#### Test Progress Indicators
```markdown
✅ Test A: Speed Focus - Completed (21.6s)
🔄 Test B: Quality Focus - In Progress...
⏳ Test C: Premium Focus - Queued
⏳ Test D: DSPy Optimized - Queued
```

#### Resource Usage Tracking
```markdown
Concurrent Streams: 2/4 active
AWS Bedrock Calls: 8 total (4 stage1 + 4 stage2)
MLflow Tracking: Active
Output Generation: Real-time
```

### Validation Checkpoints

#### Mid-Test Validation
- **Progress Check**: Confirm tests completing as expected
- **Resource Check**: Monitor AWS rate limits and costs
- **Quality Check**: Review initial responses for sanity
- **Error Check**: Watch for failures or timeouts

#### Completion Validation
- **Results Count**: Verify all selected tests completed
- **Output Files**: Confirm generation in project outputs folder
- **MLflow Logs**: Check experiment tracking data
- **Report Generation**: Validate comparison reports created

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Test Execution Failures
```yaml
Issue: Tests fail to start or complete
Causes:
  - AWS/USM configuration problems
  - Model availability issues
  - Resource limits exceeded
  - Network connectivity problems

Solutions:
  1. Check USM session status
  2. Verify AWS Bedrock access
  3. Reduce concurrent streams
  4. Retry with sequential mode
  5. Check network stability
```

#### Slow Performance
```yaml
Issue: Tests taking longer than expected
Causes:
  - High AWS region latency
  - Model throughput limitations
  - Complex query processing
  - Resource contention

Solutions:
  1. Use speed-focused tests (A, D)
  2. Reduce concurrent streams
  3. Simplify test queries
  4. Check AWS region selection
  5. Monitor resource usage
```

#### Inconsistent Results
```yaml
Issue: Results vary between test runs
Causes:
  - Model availability fluctuations
  - Temperature/randomness settings
  - Query ambiguity
  - Timing-dependent factors

Solutions:
  1. Use sequential mode for consistency
  2. Increase sample size
  3. Clarify test queries
  4. Document environmental conditions
  5. Run multiple iterations
```

#### Resource Limits
```yaml
Issue: AWS rate limits or capacity issues
Causes:
  - Too many concurrent requests
  - Model throughput restrictions
  - Account limits exceeded
  - Regional capacity constraints

Solutions:
  1. Reduce concurrent streams to 1-2
  2. Use sequential execution mode
  3. Space out test execution
  4. Check AWS service limits
  5. Consider different models
```

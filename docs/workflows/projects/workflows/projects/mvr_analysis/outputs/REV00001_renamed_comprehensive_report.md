## Key Findings

### 1. ðŸŸ¡ [MEDIUM] Incomplete Validation in 9 Sections

**Detail:** Found 9 sections with incomplete validation work. Sections contain TODO items, lack sufficient detail, or are missing reviewer signatures.

**Evidence:** Section A, Section B, Section C

**Remediation:** Review flagged sections for completeness. Ensure all TODO items are resolved and proper reviewer sign-off is obtained.

---

## Pending Items

The following items require immediate attention:

1. Finalize A: Planning & Scoping - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
2. Finalize B: Stakeholders & Governance Setup - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
3. Finalize C: Regulatory & Policy Alignment - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
4. Finalize D: Conceptual Soundness â€“ Theory - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
5. Finalize E: Conceptual Soundness â€“ Variables - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
6. Finalize F: Data Governance - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
7. Finalize I: Development Practices â€“ Estimation - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
8. Finalize J: Model Performance â€“ In-Sample - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
9. Finalize L: Stress Testing & Sensitivity - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off

## Requirements Analysis

### Current Model Characteristics

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Model Type** | Traditional |
| **Risk Tier** | High |
| **Review Activity** | Full Scope Validation |
| **Third Party** | False |
| **Required Sections** | 9 |
| **VST-Scoped Sections** | 9 |

**Section List:** A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, L

### Model Type Comparison (at High Risk)

| Model Type | Total Sections | VST Sections | Section Numbers | Current |
|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| AI/ML | 10 | 10 | A, B, C, D, E, F... |  |
| GenAI | 10 | 10 | A, B, C, D, E, F... |  |
| Traditional | 9 | 9 | A, B, C, D, E, F... | âœ… |
| Integrator | 7 | 7 | A, B, C, E, F, I... |  |
| SDC | 7 | 7 | A, B, C, E, F, I... |  |
| Qualitative | 4 | 4 | A, B, F, J |  |

### Risk Tier Scaling (for Traditional Models)

| Risk Tier | Total Sections | VST Sections | Section Numbers | Current |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| High | 9 | 9 | A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J... | âœ… |
| Medium | 8 | 8 | A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J |  |
| Low | 5 | 5 | A, B, C, F, J |  |

### Key Requirements Insights

1. Risk tier scaling: High (9) vs Low (5) = 4 fewer sections for lower risk
2. All required sections are VST-scoped (high regulatory scrutiny)

### VST (Validation Support Tool) Analysis

VST sections require enhanced documentation and evidence standards:

**VST-Required Sections:** A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, L (9 sections)

**VST Coverage by Risk Tier:**
- **High:** 9/9 sections (100% VST-scoped)
- **Medium:** 8/8 sections (100% VST-scoped)
- **Low:** 5/5 sections (100% VST-scoped)

---

## Regulatory Context

### Validation Complexity Assessment

**Complexity Level:** Medium  
**Regulatory Note:** Standard validation approach with model-specific requirements

### Model-Specific Requirements

- **Traditional Focus:** Section L (Stress Testing) required for High risk models

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)

1. Finalize A: Planning & Scoping - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
2. Finalize B: Stakeholders & Governance Setup - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off
3. Finalize C: Regulatory & Policy Alignment - resolve TODO items and obtain reviewer sign-off

### Quality Improvement Focus

Based on the scoring analysis:

- **Compliance:** Strong
- **Coverage:** Strong
- **Clarity:** Needs Improvement
- **Challenge:** Needs Improvement

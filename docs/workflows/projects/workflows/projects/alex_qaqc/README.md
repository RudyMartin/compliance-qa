# Alex QAQC - Quality Assurance & Quality Control Workflow

## Overview
Alex QAQC is a comprehensive 4-step workflow designed for quality assurance and quality control analysis of PDF documents. The workflow systematically extracts metadata, performs detailed analysis, aggregates results, and records 5 key analysis questions with a comprehensive summary.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Metadata Extraction
- Extracts document metadata, structure, and basic properties
- Identifies document type, author, version, creation date
- Analyzes text statistics and document structure
- **Output**: `document_metadata.json`, `document_structure.json`, `text_statistics.json`

### 2. QAQC Analysis Steps
- Performs comprehensive quality assurance analysis
- Conducts compliance checking against standards
- Performs technical analysis based on focus area
- Validates content accuracy and reliability
- **Output**: `quality_assessment.json`, `compliance_results.json`, `technical_analysis.json`, `content_validation.json`

### 3. Results Aggregation
- Synthesizes all analysis results into coherent findings
- Creates executive summary and detailed findings
- Generates improvement recommendations
- **Output**: `aggregated_analysis.json`, `executive_summary.json`, `detailed_findings.json`

### 4. Recording Analysis Questions & Summary
- Records 5 key analysis questions with detailed answers
- Creates final comprehensive summary
- Generates complete QAQC report
- **Output**: `five_analysis_questions.json`, `alex_qaqc_summary.json`, `alex_qaqc_complete_report.json`

## The 5 Analysis Questions

1. **Quality Assessment**: What is the overall quality score and key quality indicators?
2. **Compliance Status**: What compliance requirements are met or violated?
3. **Technical Analysis**: What technical issues or strengths were identified?
4. **Content Validation**: How reliable and accurate is the document content?
5. **Recommendations**: What are the top 3 recommendations for improvement?

## Template Fields

### Metadata Fields (`template_field: true`)
- **document_title**: Document title or identifier
- **document_type**: Type of document (report, manual, specification, procedure, policy, unknown)
- **author**: Document author or organization
- **version**: Document version number
- **creation_date**: Document creation date

### Configuration Fields
- **input_files**: PDF files for analysis (required)
- **analysis_focus**: Focus area (comprehensive, technical, compliance, quality, financial)
- **quality_threshold**: Quality confidence threshold (0.1-1.0, default: 0.85)
- **include_recommendations**: Include improvement recommendations (default: true)
- **output_format**: Level of detail (summary, detailed, full)

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF Documents**: Place PDF files in the `inputs/` directory or upload via the interface
2. **Configure Metadata**: Fill in document metadata fields (title, type, author, version, date)
3. **Set Analysis Parameters**: Choose analysis focus and quality thresholds
4. **Run Workflow**: Execute the 4-step QAQC analysis
5. **Review Results**: Check the 5 analysis questions and comprehensive summary

## Output Files

### Primary Outputs
- `alex_qaqc_complete_report.json` - Complete QAQC analysis report
- `five_analysis_questions.json` - 5 key analysis questions with answers
- `alex_qaqc_summary.json` - Executive summary of findings

### Supporting Outputs
- `document_metadata.json` - Extracted metadata
- `quality_assessment.json` - Quality analysis results
- `aggregated_analysis.json` - Aggregated findings

## Performance Specifications
- **Execution Time**: ~45 seconds per workflow
- **File Support**: PDF documents up to 50MB
- **Batch Processing**: Up to 5 files simultaneously
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ target
- **Quality Threshold**: 85%+ default minimum

## Quality Gates
- Metadata extraction: minimum 5 fields, 80% confidence
- Analysis steps: quality threshold compliance, all 4 checks required
- Results aggregation: minimum 3 findings, 85% confidence
- Question recording: all 5 questions required, 90% confidence

This workflow is ideal for document review, compliance checking, technical analysis, and quality assurance processes across various industries and document types.

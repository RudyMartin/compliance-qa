# Step 2: QAQC Analysis Steps

## Overview
Perform comprehensive Quality Assurance and Quality Control analysis across multiple dimensions: quality assessment, compliance checking, technical analysis, and content validation.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Quality Assessment
**Objective**: Evaluate overall document quality and readability

#### Text Quality Analysis
- **Clarity**: Assess text readability, sentence structure, paragraph flow
- **Consistency**: Check formatting uniformity, style consistency
- **Completeness**: Verify all sections present, no missing content
- **Accuracy**: Cross-check facts, figures, and references

#### Visual Quality Analysis
- **Layout**: Evaluate page layout, spacing, alignment
- **Typography**: Assess font consistency, size appropriateness
- **Graphics**: Review image quality, chart clarity, diagram effectiveness
- **Overall Presentation**: Professional appearance, visual hierarchy

#### Scoring Criteria (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Text clarity and readability: 25%
- Content completeness: 25%
- Visual presentation: 25%
- Technical accuracy: 25%

### 2. Compliance Checking
**Objective**: Verify adherence to standards and requirements

#### Document Standards
- **Structure Compliance**: Required sections, standard formatting
- **Content Requirements**: Mandatory information inclusion
- **Version Control**: Proper versioning, change tracking
- **Authorization**: Approval signatures, review dates

#### Regulatory Compliance (if applicable)
- **Industry Standards**: Sector-specific requirements
- **Legal Requirements**: Regulatory compliance markers
- **Safety Standards**: Safety documentation requirements
- **Quality Standards**: QMS compliance indicators

#### Compliance Scoring
- Pass/Fail for critical requirements
- Weighted scoring for optional standards
- Risk assessment for non-compliance items

### 3. Technical Analysis
**Objective**: Evaluate technical content accuracy and implementation feasibility

#### Technical Content Review
- **Accuracy**: Verify technical facts, calculations, specifications
- **Completeness**: Check all technical details provided
- **Clarity**: Assess technical explanation quality
- **Implementation**: Evaluate feasibility of procedures/recommendations

#### Focus Area Analysis
Based on `analysis_focus` parameter:
- **Comprehensive**: All technical aspects evaluated
- **Technical**: Deep dive into technical specifications
- **Compliance**: Focus on regulatory technical requirements
- **Quality**: Emphasis on quality metrics and standards
- **Financial**: Technical aspects of financial procedures

#### Technical Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Critical technical errors or omissions
- **Medium Risk**: Minor technical issues requiring attention
- **Low Risk**: Suggestions for technical improvement
- **No Risk**: Technically sound content

### 4. Content Validation
**Objective**: Assess content reliability, accuracy, and trustworthiness

#### Factual Verification
- **Data Accuracy**: Verify statistics, figures, measurements
- **Reference Validation**: Check citations, sources, links
- **Cross-Reference Check**: Internal consistency verification
- **Currency**: Information freshness and relevance

#### Logical Consistency
- **Argument Flow**: Logical progression of ideas
- **Conclusion Support**: Evidence supporting conclusions
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identify conflicting statements
- **Gap Analysis**: Missing logical connections

#### Reliability Scoring
- **High Confidence**: Well-sourced, consistent, verifiable
- **Medium Confidence**: Generally reliable with minor issues
- **Low Confidence**: Questionable accuracy or consistency
- **Uncertain**: Insufficient information for validation

## Processing Workflow

### Input Integration
- Use metadata from Step 1 for context
- Apply user-specified `analysis_focus`
- Set quality thresholds from `quality_threshold` parameter
- Consider document type for specialized analysis

### Analysis Execution
1. **Parallel Processing**: Run all 4 analysis types simultaneously
2. **Cross-Validation**: Compare findings across analysis types
3. **Risk Prioritization**: Flag high-priority issues first
4. **Evidence Collection**: Gather supporting evidence for findings

### Quality Gates
- Each analysis must meet minimum confidence threshold
- Critical compliance issues trigger immediate flagging
- Technical risks assessed and prioritized
- Content validation confidence levels recorded

## Output Requirements

### Primary Analysis Outputs
- `quality_assessment.json`: Complete quality scoring and findings
- `compliance_results.json`: Compliance status and violations
- `technical_analysis.json`: Technical review results and risks
- `content_validation.json`: Content reliability assessment

### Required Data Structure
Each output must include:
- **Overall Score**: Quantitative assessment (0.0-1.0)
- **Detailed Findings**: Specific issues and strengths identified
- **Evidence**: Supporting data for conclusions
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions
- **Risk Level**: Priority classification for issues
- **Confidence Score**: Analysis reliability indicator

## Success Criteria
- All 4 analysis types completed successfully
- Overall quality score meets `quality_threshold`
- Compliance status clearly determined
- Technical risks properly classified
- Content validation confidence â‰¥ threshold

This comprehensive analysis provides the foundation for aggregation and final reporting in subsequent steps.

## Processing Workflow

### 1. Question Generation
- Extract relevant data from all previous steps
- Apply analysis focus to emphasize appropriate areas
- Ensure each question has comprehensive supporting data
- Validate that all 5 questions can be answered with available data

### 2. Answer Compilation
- Synthesize findings from metadata extraction, analysis steps, and aggregation
- Provide specific evidence for each answer
- Include confidence scores for reliability assessment
- Cross-reference answers for consistency

### 3. Summary Creation
- Create executive summary combining all question answers
- Highlight most critical findings and recommendations
- Provide overall assessment and next steps
- Include metadata and processing statistics

### 4. Final Report Assembly
- Combine all components into comprehensive report
- Add timestamps and processing metadata
- Include workflow execution summary
- Validate completeness and accuracy

## Output Generation

### Primary Outputs (with timestamps)
- `outputs/final_{timestamp}.json` - Complete QAQC report
- `outputs/five_analysis_questions_{timestamp}.json` - Questions and answers
- `outputs/alex_qaqc_summary_{timestamp}.json` - Executive summary

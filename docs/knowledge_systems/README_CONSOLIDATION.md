# Knowledge Systems Consolidation

This document tracks the consolidation of all RAG and knowledge management systems into a unified architecture.

## Goal
Consolidate competing RAG systems into a single unified knowledge management platform using the existing enterprise-grade `knowledge_systems/` architecture.

## Directory Structure

### Core Systems (Keep - Already Working)
- `core/` - Enterprise knowledge management platform
- `interfaces/` - KnowledgeInterface API
- `facades/` - Document processing and storage facades
- `flow_agreements/` - Workflow integration

### Consolidated Systems (New)
- `migrated/compliance/` - Moved from tidyllm/compliance/
- `migrated/scattered_rag/` - Various RAG builders throughout codebase
- `migrated/portal_rag/` - Portal-specific RAG implementations

### Evaluation Areas (New)
- `uncertain/duplicate_systems/` - Potential duplicates needing evaluation
- `uncertain/legacy/` - Old implementations to analyze
- `uncertain/experimental/` - Prototype/test code

## Migration Progress

### Phase 1: Structure Setup âœ“
- [x] Created migration directories
- [x] Created evaluation documentation

### Phase 2: System Identification & Movement
- [ ] Inventory all RAG systems
- [ ] Move compliance domain RAG
- [ ] Move scattered RAG builders
- [ ] Move uncertain/duplicate items

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Update KnowledgeInterface for migrated domains
- [ ] Update portal integrations
- [ ] Test unified system

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] All portals work with unified system
- [ ] Clean architecture validated
- [ ] No competing systems active

## Benefits
- Single point of entry for all knowledge operations
- Consistent API across all domains
- Enterprise-grade configuration management
- Workflow integration through Flow Agreements
- Multi-domain support with proper isolation

# Uncertain/Duplicate RAG Systems - Evaluation Required

This folder contains RAG systems and components that need evaluation before final migration decisions.

## Structure

### `duplicate_systems/`
**NEW CODE CREATED DURING CONSOLIDATION - NEEDS REVIEW**

- `vectorqa_service/` - Entire VectorQA service infrastructure created during consolidation
  - **STATUS**: User feedback "DO NOT CREATE NEW CODE THIS IS TOO MUCH NEW UNTESTED CODE"
  - **DECISION NEEDED**: Delete entirely or extract useful patterns?

- `vectorRAG_wrapper.py` - Wrapper I created to bridge existing systems
  - **STATUS**: User preferred this over new infrastructure but concerned about competing systems
  - **DECISION NEEDED**: Keep as bridge or integrate patterns into KnowledgeInterface?

### `legacy/`
**LEGACY/INACTIVE SYSTEMS - EVALUATE FOR DELETION**

- `rag_adapters_inactive/` - Previously inactive RAG adapter systems
  - Contains old compliance domain RAG implementations
  - Contains legacy knowledge systems core
  - **DECISION NEEDED**: Delete or preserve for reference?

- `pending_rag_tools/` - Legacy query and finder tools from pending directory
  - Old query interfaces (query_real_rags.py, simple_query_rags.py, etc.)
  - Legacy RAG finder utilities
  - **DECISION NEEDED**: Delete or extract useful functionality?

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Duplicates with Core Systems**: Does this duplicate functionality in `tidyllm/knowledge_systems/core/`?
2. **Integration Value**: Does this contain patterns worth integrating into KnowledgeInterface?
3. **Legacy Value**: Does this contain historical knowledge worth preserving?
4. **Testing Coverage**: Is this code tested and proven in production?

## Recommendations

### High Priority Evaluation
1. `vectorqa_service/` - Large new codebase created during consolidation
2. `vectorRAG_wrapper.py` - Bridge code that user was "comfortable with"

### Low Priority Evaluation
1. `rag_adapters_inactive/` - Already marked inactive, likely safe to delete
2. `pending_rag_tools/` - Legacy tools, functionality likely replaced

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 3.1**: Create backup branch before any deletions
2. **Phase 3.2**: Evaluate each system with testing
3. **Phase 3.3**: Extract valuable patterns into KnowledgeInterface
4. **Phase 4.1**: Delete confirmed duplicates/obsolete systems
5. **Phase 4.2**: Validate clean architecture with no competing systems

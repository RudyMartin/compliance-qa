# Connection Pattern Fix Summary

## What Was Broken

The infrastructure had a **pattern mismatch**:
- **ResilientPoolManager** provided connections via context managers (`with pool.get_connection()`)
- **RAG adapters** expected raw connections to call `.cursor()` on
- **InfraDelegate** couldn't properly translate between these incompatible patterns

## What We Fixed

### 1. Added psycopg2 Interface to ResilientPoolManager
```python
# Added getconn() and putconn() methods
def getconn(self):
    # Returns raw connection with failover support

def putconn(self, conn):
    # Returns connection to appropriate pool
```

### 2. Updated InfraDelegate to Use Consistent Interface
```python
def get_db_connection(self):
    # Always uses getconn() - returns raw connection
    return self._db_pool.getconn()

def return_db_connection(self, conn):
    # Always uses putconn()
    self._db_pool.putconn(conn)
```

### 3. Fixed TidyLLMConnectionPool
- Changed from circular dependency (calling back to infra delegate)
- Now uses real psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool internally
- Exposes getconn/putconn methods for consistency

## Test Results

✅ **All adapters now working:**
- SME RAG Adapter: Health check passes
- AI-Powered Adapter: Health check passes
- Intelligent Adapter: Health check passes

✅ **Connections are proper psycopg2 connections:**
```
Type: <class 'psycopg2.extensions.connection'>
Has cursor?: True
Query result: (1,)
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Single Pattern**: Everything uses psycopg2 pool interface (getconn/putconn)
2. **No Breaking Changes**: RAG adapters work without modification
3. **Preserved Features**: ResilientPoolManager still has failover, metrics, health checks
4. **Clean Abstraction**: InfraDelegate provides consistent interface regardless of underlying pool

## Remaining Cleanup (Optional)

While the system is now working, we could simplify further:

1. **Remove DelegatePool wrapper** in multiple places (no longer needed)
2. **Simplify connection_pool.py** (could use psycopg2 pool directly)
3. **Consider removing context manager** from ResilientPoolManager.get_connection()

But these are non-critical improvements. The system is functional.

## Key Lesson

**Don't mix connection patterns**. Pick one and stick with it:
- Raw connections with manual cleanup (what we chose)
- OR context managers everywhere (more Pythonic but requires full rewrite)

Trying to support both creates complexity and bugs.

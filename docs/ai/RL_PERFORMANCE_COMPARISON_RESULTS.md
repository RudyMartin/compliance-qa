- **Learning Rate**: 0.0099 (exact match)
- **Temperature**: 1.4030 (exact match)

## Technical Analysis

### Why TLM Outperformed NumPy

1. **Zero Import Overhead**: TLM uses pure Python built-ins
2. **Lightweight Operations**: No heavy matrix operations for small datasets
3. **Direct Computation**: No function call overhead through NumPy C extensions
4. **Optimized for Use Case**: Custom functions tailored for RL operations

### NumPy Overhead Analysis

NumPy's performance disadvantage in this specific use case stems from:
- **Import and initialization costs** for small operations
- **Array creation overhead** for small datasets
- **Function call overhead** through C extensions
- **General-purpose optimization** not suited for lightweight RL operations

## Implementation Details

### TLM Implementation Features

```python
class TLM:
    """Teaching Library Math - NumPy-like functions using pure Python."""

    @staticmethod
    def mean(values: List[float]) -> float:
        return sum(values) / len(values) if values else 0

    @staticmethod
    def correlation(x: List[float], y: List[float]) -> float:
        # Pure Python correlation calculation
        # No external dependencies
```

### Key Advantages of TLM Approach

✅ **Zero Dependencies**: No external libraries required
✅ **Lightweight**: Minimal memory footprint
✅ **Fast**: Optimized for small-scale RL operations
✅ **Transparent**: Pure Python, easy to debug and modify
✅ **Portable**: Works everywhere Python runs

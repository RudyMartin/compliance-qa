### 🎯 **qa-shipping FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS**

Based on these 7 confirmed portals, **qa-shipping** should provide:

## 1. **Portal Discovery Engine**
```python
class PortalDiscovery:
    def scan_active_ports(self) -> List[Portal]:
        # Auto-detect all 7 portals
        # Verify portal health and functionality
        # Return portal registry with metadata
```

## 2. **Unified Portal Dashboard**
```python
class PortalDashboard:
    def render_portal_grid(self):
        # Display all 7 portals in organized grid
        # Show portal status (active/inactive/error)
        # Provide direct links to each portal
```

## 3. **Portal Health Monitoring**
```python
class PortalMonitor:
    def check_portal_health(self, port: int) -> HealthStatus:
        # Monitor uptime, response time, errors
        # Track resource usage per portal
        # Alert on portal failures
```

## 4. **Portal Orchestration**
```python
class PortalOrchestrator:
    def start_portal(self, port: int, script_path: str):
        # Launch portal services
        # Manage portal dependencies
        # Handle port conflicts

    def stop_portal(self, port: int):
        # Gracefully shutdown portal
        # Clean up resources
```

## 5. **Portal Shipping & Deployment**
```python
class PortalShipping:
    def package_portal_bundle(self) -> PortalBundle:
        # Package all 7 portals for deployment
        # Include configurations and dependencies
        # Create portable deployment package
```

### 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

1. **Phase 1**: Portal Discovery & Registry ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Unified Dashboard Creation
3. **Phase 3**: Health Monitoring System
4. **Phase 4**: Portal Orchestration Engine
5. **Phase 5**: Shipping & Deployment Tools

### 💡 **RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS**

The qa-shipping system should become the **"Mission Control"** for your 7-portal ecosystem:

- **Central command center** for all portal operations
- **Health monitoring dashboard** showing real-time status
- **One-click access** to any of the 7 portals
- **Automated deployment** and shipping capabilities
- **Load balancing** and traffic routing between portals

This will transform your portal management from manual to fully automated orchestration.

# Business Signature System Documentation

## Overview

The Business Signature System is a domain-driven architecture for creating DSPy signatures from business requirements. It addresses the fundamental question: **"Is it the business requirements or the process?"** by prioritizing business domain knowledge over technical implementation details.

## Core Philosophy

**Business Requirements First**: The system captures what the business needs before determining how to implement it. Business stakeholders express their requirements in domain language, and the system translates these into executable DSPy signatures while preserving business context.

## Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design
The system follows hexagonal architecture principles with clear separation between:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic and domain concepts
- **Application Layer**: Orchestration and workflow integration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical implementation and persistence
- **Portal Layer**: User interfaces and business interaction

### Key Components

1. **Business Signature Service** (`domain/services/business_signature_service.py`)
2. **Business Requirement Portal** (`portals/flow/business_requirement_portal.py`)
3. **Domain Templates** (`domain/templates/business_signature_templates.py`)
4. **Workflow Integration** (enhanced workflow domain service)

## Core Concepts

### Business Requirements
Structured capture of business needs including:
- **Business Question**: The core business problem to solve
- **Business Context**: Domain area (Financial Analysis, Contract Review, etc.)
- **Requirement Type**: Process pattern (Decision, Validation, Analysis, etc.)
- **Success Criteria**: How business success is measured
- **Business Rules**: Constraints and requirements
- **Stakeholder Requirements**: User-specific needs

### Business Signatures
Domain-driven DSPy signatures that:
- Preserve business vocabulary and concepts
- Include business validation rules
- Generate with business context intact
- Provide business-readable documentation
- Support business test scenarios

### Domain Templates
Pre-built patterns for common business domains:
- **Financial Analysis**: Health assessment, investment decisions
- **Contract Review**: Risk assessment, compliance validation
- **Compliance Check**: Regulatory compliance, audit preparation
- **Quality Assurance**: Quality control, process improvement
- **Risk Assessment**: Business risk evaluation
- **Document Processing**: Classification, extraction

## Usage Guide

### 1. Capturing Business Requirements

#### Through the Portal
1. Navigate to the Business Requirement Capture portal
2. Enter your core business question in natural language
3. Select the appropriate business domain and requirement type
4. Define success criteria and business rules
5. Specify stakeholder requirements
6. Capture the requirement for signature generation

#### Example Business Question
```
"How do I determine if a contract poses financial risk to our organization?"
```

#### Business Context Selection
- Financial Analysis
- Contract Review
- Compliance Check
- Quality Assurance
- Risk Assessment
- Document Processing
- Customer Service
- Operational Workflow

### 2. Generating Business Signatures

The system converts business requirements into DSPy signatures:

```python
# Example generated signature
class FinancialHealthAssessmentProcessor(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Assess the financial health and stability of a company

    Business Context: Financial Analysis
    Requirement Type: Analysis Pattern
    """

    # Business Input Fields
    financial_statements = dspy.InputField(desc="Complete set of company financial statements")
    market_context = dspy.InputField(desc="Relevant market and industry conditions")
    analysis_period = dspy.InputField(desc="Time period for financial analysis")

    # Business Output Fields
    financial_health_score = dspy.OutputField(desc="Overall financial health rating (0-100)")
    liquidity_assessment = dspy.OutputField(desc="Company's liquidity position and risks")
    risk_factors = dspy.OutputField(desc="Key financial risk factors identified")
    management_recommendations = dspy.OutputField(desc="Strategic financial recommendations")
```

### 3. Deploying as Business Tools

Business signatures become workflow tools available through Flow Macros:

```
[BUSINESS_TOOL:financial_health_assessment] company_financials.pdf
[BUSINESS_TOOL:contract_risk_assessment] contract_document.pdf
[BUSINESS_TOOL:compliance_check] regulatory_document.pdf
```

## Business Domain Templates

### Financial Analysis Domain

#### Financial Health Assessment
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive financial health evaluation
- **Inputs**: Financial statements, market context, analysis period
- **Outputs**: Health score, liquidity assessment, recommendations

- **Inputs**: Investment proposal, projections, market analysis
- **Outputs**: Recommendation, viability analysis, risk evaluation
- **Business Logic**: ROI analysis, strategic alignment, risk assessment

### Contract Review Domain

#### Contract Risk Assessment
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive contract risk evaluation
- **Inputs**: Contract document, review criteria, legal framework

## Integration with Workflow System

### Flow Macro Integration
Business signatures integrate seamlessly with the existing Flow Macro system:

```python
# Available in Flow Creator
flow_macros = orchestration_service.get_available_flow_macros()
# Returns both standard macros and business signature tools

# Execute business tool
result = orchestration_service.execute_business_tool_macro(
    "financial_health_assessment",
    {"financial_statements": "data.pdf"}
)
```

### Workflow Service Integration
The workflow domain service includes business signature capabilities:

```python
# Create business signature workflow
workflow_result = workflow_service.create_business_signature_workflow(
    signature_id="financial_health_assessment",
    business_inputs={"financial_statements": "company_data.pdf"}
)

# List available business tools
business_tools = workflow_service.list_business_signature_tools()
```

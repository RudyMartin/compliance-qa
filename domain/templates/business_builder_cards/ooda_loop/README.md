# Business Builder Cards - OODA Loop Organization

## Overview

The Business Builder cards are organized using the OODA Loop framework (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Loop) to provide a structured approach to intelligent workflow creation and execution.

## OODA Loop Stages

### üîç **Observe Stage** (`/observe/`)
**Purpose**: Data gathering, monitoring, and initial processing
- **Focus**: Raw data acquisition and preparation
- **AI Involvement**: Moderate (quality assessment)
- **Cards**: Document extraction, unified document analysis
- **Outputs**: Raw data, extracted content, embeddings, metadata

### üß† **Orient Stage** (`/orient/`)
**Purpose**: Analysis, pattern recognition, and content understanding
- **Focus**: Understanding and contextualizing data
- **AI Involvement**: High (complex reasoning and pattern recognition)
- **Cards**: Content intelligence, entity extraction, sentiment analysis
- **Outputs**: Entities, classifications, patterns, relationships, context

### üí° **Decide Stage** (`/decide/`)
**Purpose**: Decision-making, strategy formation, and recommendation generation
- **Focus**: Strategic decision-making and planning
- **AI Involvement**: Very High (strategic thinking and decision support)
- **Cards**: Insight synthesis, strategic recommendations
- **Outputs**: Decisions, strategies, recommendations, action plans, priorities

### ‚ö° **Act Stage** (`/act/`)
**Purpose**: Execution, implementation, and action orchestration
- **Focus**: Implementation and execution
- **AI Involvement**: Moderate (monitoring and coordination)
- **Cards**: Workflow execution, action implementation
- **Outputs**: Results, outcomes, deliverables, metrics, status

### üîÑ **Loop Stage** (`/loop/`)
**Purpose**: Feedback, optimization, and continuous improvement
- **Focus**: Learning and optimization
- **AI Involvement**: Very High (learning algorithms and strategic improvement)
- **Cards**: RL optimization, performance analysis, feedback loops
- **Outputs**: Feedback, optimizations, improvements, learning, adaptations

## Unified Actions Architecture

All cards in this OODA organization use the **Unified Actions** architecture, which combines:
- **TidyLLM Functions**: Sovereign code for data processing and technical operations
- **AI Prompts**: Intelligence layer for analysis, reasoning, and decision-making

This revolutionary approach allows each card to seamlessly integrate technical processing with AI intelligence in a single step.

## Card Types

### Standard Cards
- Single-purpose actions (like the original `extract_document_text`)
- Traditional action-only or prompt-only steps

### Unified Cards
- **NEW**: Combine TidyLLM functions + AI analysis in one step
- Both `action` and `prompt` phases in the same step definition
- Optimal for complex workflows requiring both processing and intelligence

## Usage Patterns

### Linear OODA Flow
```
Observe ‚Üí Orient ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Loop
```

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple Observe cards can run in parallel
- Orient cards can process different aspects simultaneously
- Decide stage synthesizes all inputs

### Iterative Improvement
- Loop stage feeds back to earlier stages
- RL optimization improves future cycles
- Continuous learning and adaptation

## Business Value

This OODA organization provides:
1. **Structured Thinking**: Clear progression from data to action
2. **Situational Awareness**: Comprehensive understanding before action
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Decisions based on thorough analysis
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement through feedback
5. **Unified Intelligence**: TidyLLM + AI integration for optimal performance

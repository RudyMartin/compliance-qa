 3Validation Goes Beyond Ticking the Box
Validation is about evaluating whether the 
chosen model is capable of delivering 
sound results and whether it meets the 
needs for which it was designed .
Model Validation
 4»Reliable Second Line of Defense
»External validation can review and 
challenge risk management without 
conflicts of interest
»Constructive criticism
»Unbiased advice 
»Guidance and direction
»Top-notch expertiseOur Take on Validation

 7Model Evaluation
Action Ratings
Satisfactory
The model has no critical 
findings and is suitable for 
deployment. 
Satisfactory with 
recommendations
The model’s performance is 
satisfactory and is suitable 
for deployment. 
Nevertheless, the validators 
have identified areas where 
the model could undergo 
improvements that may 
improve its overall 
performance. 
Needs improvement
The validators have 
identified multiple critical 
findings that have a negative 
impact on the model’s 
performance. The current 
model provides at least a 
minimally adequate level of 
performance and can be 
used in its present form. 
Unfit for Use
There are important flaws in 
the model’s underlying data, 
conceptual framework, or 
development process. Either i) 
the model cannot perform its 
intended function and should 
not be used in any decision -
making capacity or ii) there is 
not enough evidence to show 
that the model can perform its 
intended function and it should 
not be used in any decision -
making capacity until such 
evidence becomes available.Model Validation

opinion of model
»Benchmark, then 
benchmark some more
»Write an effective, 
useful validation report 
»Avoid the “checking the 
box” trap»Develop multiple models
»Write effective, relevant 
documentation
»Archive data, scripts, 
etc., for future reference
»Respond to validators

 14Key Challenges: Scorecards
Target Variable Definition & 
Classification
‘Bad’ definition based on the 
objective of the scorecard.
Classification based on 
performance window Variable / Feature  
Selection

characteristics should be 
included to be selected as 
predictors.External

Key Challenges: Stress Testing
»Internal data availability vs. economic cycle
»How does the bank’s experience compare to its peers?
»Will the next severely adverse shock generate a 
recession that looks like the previous financial crisis?Model Validation

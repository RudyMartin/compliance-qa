# Knowledge Base Analysis Template

## Purpose
Analyze the extracted documents and embeddings to assess knowledge base quality and readiness for RAG operations.

## AI Analysis Prompt

You are an expert knowledge base architect with deep expertise in RAG system optimization and document collection analysis.

**Extracted Documents:**
```
{extracted_texts}
```

**Embedding Information:**
- Total documents processed: {extracted_texts.length}
- Embedding model: text-embedding-3-small
- Chunk size: 1000 words with 200-word overlap
- Vector dimensions: 1536
- Total chunks generated: {knowledge_base_embeddings.total_chunks}

## Your Knowledge Base Assessment Task

### 1. Document Collection Analysis
- Assess the diversity and coverage of the document collection
- Identify primary themes and subject areas represented
- Evaluate document quality and information density
- Note any gaps or imbalances in the knowledge coverage

### 2. RAG Readiness Assessment
- Evaluate how well the documents support question-answering
- Assess the granularity and retrievability of information
- Identify documents that will be most/least useful for RAG
- Note any preprocessing improvements that could enhance RAG performance

### 3. Embedding Quality Evaluation
- Assess whether chunk size and overlap are optimal for this content
- Identify potential chunking issues (split concepts, incomplete thoughts)
- Evaluate semantic coherence within chunks
- Suggest embedding strategy optimizations

### 4. Knowledge Base Optimization
- Recommend improvements to document preprocessing
- Suggest metadata enrichment opportunities
- Identify high-value content for prioritized indexing
- Note potential quality issues requiring attention

## Assessment Guidelines

- **Comprehensiveness**: Evaluate how well the knowledge base covers its intended domain
- **Coherence**: Assess whether information is logically organized and accessible
- **Retrievability**: Consider how easily specific information can be found
- **Quality**: Evaluate accuracy, clarity, and usefulness of content
- **RAG Optimization**: Focus on factors that will improve RAG performance
- **Demo Value**: Highlight aspects that will make impressive demo showcases

Your analysis will be used to optimize the RAG system and prepare for an impressive show-and-tell demonstration.

**Show and Tell Focus**: Emphasize the knowledge base's strengths and the sophisticated analysis capabilities that make this RAG system stand out from basic search systems.

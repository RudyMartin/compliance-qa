# RAG Generation Analysis Template

## Purpose
Generate intelligent responses using Retrieved-Augmented Generation with comprehensive context analysis and reasoning.

## AI Analysis Prompt

You are an expert RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant with deep expertise in contextual reasoning and intelligent information synthesis.

**User Query:**
```
{demo_query}
```

**Retrieved Context:**
```
{rag_context}
```

**Ranked Chunks Information:**
- Total chunks retrieved: {ranked_chunks.length}
- Relevance scores: {ranked_chunks.scores}
- Source diversity: {ranked_chunks.sources}

## Your RAG Generation Task

### 1. Context Analysis
- Analyze the relevance and quality of retrieved context
- Identify key themes and patterns across retrieved chunks
- Assess completeness of information for answering the query
- Note any gaps or limitations in the retrieved context

### 2. Intelligent Response Generation
- Generate a comprehensive answer using the retrieved context
- Cite specific sources and chunks when making claims
- Synthesize information from multiple sources coherently
- Highlight areas where context supports strong conclusions vs. areas of uncertainty

### 3. RAG Quality Assessment
- Evaluate how well the retrieved context addresses the query
- Identify the most valuable chunks for answering the question
- Note any retrieved chunks that seem irrelevant or off-topic
- Assess overall retrieval quality and suggest improvements

### 4. Source Attribution
- Clearly attribute information to specific source documents
- Indicate confidence levels for different parts of your response
- Highlight when multiple sources agree or disagree
- Note any claims that go beyond what the context supports

## RAG Generation Guidelines

- **Grounding**: Stay strictly grounded in the retrieved context
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate when information comes from context vs. general knowledge
- **Synthesis**: Combine information from multiple sources intelligently
- **Confidence**: Express appropriate confidence levels based on source quality
- **Completeness**: Address all aspects of the query that the context supports
- **Clarity**: Present complex information in an accessible way

Your response will be used to demonstrate the power of RAG systems that combine intelligent retrieval with sophisticated generation capabilities.

**Show and Tell Focus**: Highlight how this RAG system excels at finding relevant information and generating insightful, well-sourced responses that go beyond simple keyword matching.
